		    	<h3>Broad Exploration of Ideas:</h3>
		    	
<div class="design-sketches-content">		    	
<strong>Pokemon - Which pokemon are you most similar to?</strong>
<p>User: Kids who play Pokemon, adolescents who want to feel nostalgic about playing Pokemon as a kid, Pokemon fanatics</p>
<p>Context of Use: This application could be featured outside gaming conventions or at Pokemon Center Stores across the world. As the users try to create the shape of a pokemon with their shadows, the application guesses the pokemon that the user made. The pokemon that users create could be stored so that in addition to trying to imitate pokemon with their shadows, users can also try to catch pokemon by throwing virtual poke balls.</p>

<p>Design Decision Rationale: The design of this application should be upbeat and in the style of the Pokemon video games in order to draw crowds at Pokemon gaming events and conventions. To create more complicated pokemon shadows, multiple people could come together and create a single pokemon. Additionally, to simulate the experience of being a real-life Pokemon trainer, two people could enter the game at once and capture existing Pokemon (made of shadows), and then use those captured Pokemon to battle.</p>

<p>User Needs/Goals: User wants to feel more involved in the Pokemon game, simulate real-life experience as a Pokemon trainer</p>

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Guess shirt size </strong>
<p>User: Adults with a credit card who want to purchase clothes online</p>
<p>Context of Use: Bob wants to buy a shirt from a new online retailer, but is not quite sure what size he is; 
sometimes he wears a size medium, sometimes he wears a size large or even XL. Bob isn't sure if the online 
measurements the website provides are accurate and even more so, how accurately he is able to measure himself 
with a measuring tape. Bob needs to accurately decide his shirt size to make his purchase and not have to worry
 about returning or exchanging. </p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: Because this application can easily be run from someone's laptop, it is suitable to 
determine the user's shirt size in the home or office setting. However, this idea may not be suitable for a public
 engagement space. One concern is that each online retailer would have different images of their shirt sizes, 
 which may make it difficult to manage. The application needs to run quickly and accurately to help the user make 
 his or her purchase in a short amount of time. In deciding a t-shirt size, the application would need to
  consider not only the front surface area of the person, but also the person's width. Perhaps we would need the
  person to stand with his or her arms raised, once facing the camera, and once facing 90 degrees away from the camera.
  Other features: this application could be applied to guess pant size as well.</p>

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Teach Yoga </strong>
<p>User: Stay at home moms or people who want to try to stay in shape but may not have time to go to the 
gym or sign up for fitness classes</p>
<p>Context of Use: Homes, Yoga centers, Fitness centers. The application will guide the user to do the appropriate
 yoga positions for a certain amount 
of time. The user will try to stay in the yoga shape. </p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: Because the application is targeted toward people who want to be healthier, the
 application would need to feel friendly and encouraging. The yoga shapes would need to be large to accommodate 
 people of various sizes and additionally we would need to incorporate additional directions and tips on holding 
 the position to enhance the learning experience of the user. This application may not be suitable for a public 
 engagement space because people may feel self-conscious of learning yoga in public. To best help the users
 learn yoga, the interface would also gently critique the users' positions.</p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: User wants to be more fit by doing yoga, but doesn't have time to sign up for a
 yoga class or go to the gym, so he/she needs a virtual yoga teacher at home.</p>

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Snowflake people/transforms  </strong>
<p>User: Children interested in science, everyday people</p>
<p>Context of Use: Can be used in an elementary school classroom during the holiday season, 
in science classes when learning about how no two snowflakes are alike, in motivational speaking presentations 
to empower people to be themselves, holiday get-togethers, create a snowy background indoors</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: Because this concept and experience can be applicable in various different 
contexts, we wanted the experience to be as simple and magical as possible, tapping into multiple senses. 
The user only needs to stand in front of the computer and create a shape with his or her body, and then stand back
 and watch as his or her shadow is multiplied and transformed to create several different types of snowflakes. Soft 
 holiday instrumental music then plays in the background as the user experiences a snowfall of snowflakes of him or herself.</p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: Experience an aesthetically pleasing snowfall while being warm indoors, understand that 
snowflakes are all created differently.</p>

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Is it safe for Kids </strong>
<p>User: To-be parents, camp counselors</p>

<p>Context of Use: As parents are preparing to learn how to baby-proof their apartment or as camp
 counselors are preparing their program for small children, this application could be a useful educational tool. 
 It could serve as an ice-breaker type activity for camp counselors or be on an online module parents-to-be are
  looking at in preparing their home for a baby.</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: The items encompassed by this application would need to be broad in order to fit 
both the needs of parents-to-be and young camp counselors. Perhaps the silhouettes shown by the application
 could be tailored according to the age of the children. For example, for children ages 1-3, one object could be 
 a coin (safe), and for children ages 5-7, an object could be a pair of child-safe scissors (safe). The user 
 could select the age range the children in mind.</p>

<p>User Needs/Goals: The user needs to determine what items in his/her house or around the camp are 
child-friendly and which ones should be put out of sight.</p>

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Virtual Frat Party </strong>
<p>User: College student who is too busy to go to a frat party, who wants the experience of going to a frat party, 
but maybe cannot leave his or her dorm room.</p>
<p>Context of Use: It is late on a Friday night and Adam wants to go to a frat party, but it's cold and
 snowy outside. He decides to be cool and have his own virtual frat party inside the comfort of his own 
 room. Adam uses this application to dance with other shadows on the application. He even gets the experience 
 of elbowing off creepers at the party if the shadows on the application get too close to him. An additional use 
 case scenario could be a spontaneous dance party in White Plaza in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: Because it is trying to simulate a frat party, the application could
 let the user select the music at the party. We wanted to make this experience as open and real as possible. 
 Multiple people can dance together in the application, as in a real frat party. The application will need to 
 let the user feels comfortable enough to either dance alone or in daylight, utilizing perhaps a dark background and 
 flashing lights.</p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: User wants to feel like he/she is at a party

<strong>How drunk are you </strong>
<p>User: Young adolescents, high school and college students</p>
<p>Context of Use: Outdoor demonstration for alcohol education and to promote safe driving</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: The user will try to walk in a straight line in front of the camera, and
 after walking, the application will replay the user's walk so he/she can see what walk corresponds to what drunkness level.</p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: User needs a sense of how he/she could walk while being intoxicated. This experience will 
help inform youth of the dangers of drinking and driving and help to prevent accidents in the future.</p>

<div class="design-sketches-content">		
<strong>Virtual Garbage Truck </strong>
<p>User: Children, teachers, parents, environmental activists</p>
<p>Context of Use: To teach people to be more eco-friendly and care for the environment by picking up trash. This 
application could be used in as an exhibit in a rally or a museum to encourage environmental protection. It could also 
be used in conjunction to a film screening of the movie Wall-E and be used in discussions in the classroom.</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: The user will pretend to be a garbage truck. In order to simulate this experience,
the user will need to pick up garbage (superimposed on the screen) at the right moment and then throw the 
garbage into the truck. Superimposing the images will allow the user to still be a garbage truck without 
requiring him/her to pick up actual physical trash. This is thus idea for a public engagement space like the 
classroom.</p>

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Password</strong>
<p>User: Young adults, people with smartphones, children</p>
<p>Context of Use: To promote cybersecurity, as an activity in a library seminar</p>
<p>Problem: Passwords are hackable and easily stolen. It is hard to remember all your passwords for Facebook, your email, blog,
 Wordpress, etc. Our application allows you to create a series of actions instead of a string as a password, which
  makes your password more secure because it is harder to copy. Additionally, studies say that doing a gesture with a
   concept will in fact help you to remember a concept better, so this application could also serve as a memory device 
   for passwords.</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: To ensure that users actually recall their passwords and do not simply stand doing
random hand gestures to attempt to guess the password, there is a 10 second interval where users can do perform
the gestures to their password. At the end of this time period, the password is either accepted or rejected. One
design concern here is that though the application was originally intended to make passwords less likely to be stolen,
passwords could still easily be stolen if this application were to be used in a public setting, for example, at Starbucks.
 In that case, other people may not know you are giving your password to a website, but should they be aware of your 
 actions, they could easily steal your password by capturing your gestures on film. </p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: The user seeks a secure way to give his or her password to a website.

<strong>Obstacle course </strong>
<p>User: Youth and Adolescents, young adults people into playing games like Mario, etc. </p>
<p>Context of Use: Outdoor quad such as White Plaza, at gaming conventions, could be used in arcades, fitness centers 
(as a light exercise/break)</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: The game could simulate other obstacle video games like Mario. To that end, the game would be side scrolling 
where your shadow has to jump over obstacles.</p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: The user needs to get through the entire side scrolling game without running into any obstacles. </p>
<img src="media/obstacle-course.jpeg" class="sketch"/>

<br /><br />

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Falling objects have to catch/avoid </strong>
<p>User: People who enjoy playing games like Fruit Ninja</p>
<p>Context of Use: Families and friends enjoying downtime together, any public space works</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: Because this is for entertainment, the game should be eye-catching, with colorful visuals
 and sound to attract audiences in a public space.</p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: The user needs to avoid certain objects falling from the top of the screen and catch other objects 
in order to score points.</p>
<img src="media/falling.jpeg" class="sketch"/>
</div>
<br /><br />

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Cooking </strong>
<p>User:Young adults who want to learn how to cook</p>
<p>Context of Use: Public spaces like schools (teach kids how to cook), cooking schools, restaurants, shopping center food courts</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: As this is an educational game/tutorial that teaches you how to cook in very basic steps, the font and language used in the 
application should be easy to read and comprehend. Visuals of tools in the user's 
hands that are superimposed at each step will help the user understand how to cook. </p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: The user wants an easy and active way to learn how to cook. 
Ideally the user could be able to do this with friends.</p>

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Virtual bow and arrow </strong>
<p>User: People practicing archery</p>
<p>Context of Use: Physical Education class, outdoor blacktop</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: The application would superimpose images of a bow and arrow onto the user's body after
the user assumes the archer stance. The application could allow the user to choose whether he or she wants to
do target practice or just shoot arrows. The target practice use case could make for a good rainy day indoor
activity for students in 
Physical Education classes. It is also a good exercise in hand eye coordination. Additionally, the application
could help users develop good form for archery. Users could stand in a template shape and the application
would critique users' form as they shot the arrow.</p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: The user wants practice in aiming arrows and perfecting the archer stance.</p>
<img src="media/bow.jpeg" class="sketch"/>
</div>
<br /><br />

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Posture corrector </strong>
<p>User: Young adults, children, people who may be likely to get scoliosis</p>
<p>Context of Use: Outdoor event promoting good posture, possibly put on by a chiropractor. Additionally,
workplaces where people may have developed bad posture, schools, department stores</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: The application would look at the user's shadow from the front and side to correct 
his or her posture. The user's side profile will be particularly telling since it may be difficult from the front 
shadow view to assess slouching and the position of the belly. Additionally, small tips on how to have
better posture along with the corrected shadow image will help users to remember the experience and
take concrete steps to protect their health in the future. </p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: Improve his or her posture</p>

<h3>Detailed Design of Three Ideas</h3>
<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Human Tetris</strong>
<p>User: children, youth and adolescents, college students, young adults, anyone who knows the game Tetris</p>
<p>Setting: White Plaza demonstration, Tresidder, Old Union, any study space.
<p>Scenario: A group of students are working together in a large open space on campus. They have been 
sitting for a very long time and need a study break, as their brains are fried from thinking and sitting
 for long periods of time. To stimulate themselves, ordinarily they would go on Facebook, Youtube, or 
 OMGPOP to connect with their friends or pull out their phones to text their friends or play some games.</p>
<p>Problem: However, in this way, students are taking a break by being "alone" together. These breaks are 
not active either and do not allow students to get their blood flowing after long periods of sitting.</p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: User needs to actively interact with their bodies and the people around them during a
 study break.</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: Inspired by the Japanese Human Tetris videos on Youtube, the game should feel
 friendly and fun. The use of bright and fun colors, as well as various game sound effects, will engage the
  users. Although the Japanese Human Tetris game involved some shapes people jump through, for our 
  application we decided not to have this feature because there would be a lag in capturing the jump
  and additional time needed to process the capture of the shadow. In order to simulate human Tetris,
  a variety of shapes slowly come toward the user and the user needs to stay within the boundaries of the shape
in order to clear the level. To engage many people in a public space, some shapes require multiple people
to join forces and create shapes. As the game engages the whole body, Human Tetris promotes active participation
among all its users and is a delightful experience for users of all ages in public spaces.</p>

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Music Radial piano</strong>
<p>User: Children interested in piano but maybe can't stay still enough to sit down and practice for long periods 
of time, youth who enjoy music</p>
<p>Context of Use: Elementary school music classrooms, lunchtime activity events</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: To enable the users to more easily reach the piano keys, the piano keyboard is
curved around the user. This way the user only needs to reach out in a spiral fashion to hit the keys. One curved 
end of the keys will be low tones, and the other end will be high tones, so that Middle C will be just above 
the user's head. </p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: The user likes playing the piano, but wants to also engage his or her whole body when playing the piano.</p>
<img src="media/piano.jpeg" class="sketch"/>
</div>
<br /><br />

<div class="design-sketches-content">
<strong>Jump on moon</strong>
<p>User: Young children interested in space</p>
<p>Context of Use: Science museum like Exploratorium, Tech Museum, Cal Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>Design Decision Rationale: The application lets the user jump and then replays and displays his or her jump 
in the form of an astronaut
after he or she has already landed. The user and the application are displayed in parallel to allow 
the user to compare between a regular jump on Earth and on the moon. In order to make the experience as real as
possible for the children, the astronaut's spacesuit could be the same color as the user's shirt. The user
could also choose if he/she is a boy or a girl. Other features of the application include the addition of either a
bulky or a slim space suit, which would be taken into consideration when calculating the height of the jump.
Users could also select which planet they want to be on to see how gravity on each planet differs. </p>
<p>User Needs/Goals: User wants to know how far he will be able to jump on the moon.</p>
